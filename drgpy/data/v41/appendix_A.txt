|     Appendix A List of MS-DRGs Version 41.0     |
:======================================================================:

Appendix A contains a list of each MS-DRG with a specification of the
MDC and whether the MS-DRG is medical or surgical. Some MS-DRGs which
contain patients from multiple MDCs (e.g., 014 Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant)
do not have an MDC specified. The letter M is used to designate a medical
MS-DRG and the letter P is used to designate a surgical MS-DRG.
